# Match3

An implementation of a Match 3 "best scoring move" function. It is not a working application, just a code demo!

This is only a basic implementation (in a console app) of the function (from no prior knowledge of these games), after being asked in a programming test to do so.

It has further optimisation to add some methods for specific areas of "move checks" performed eg. CheckDown(), CheckUp(), CheckLeft(), CheckRight(), which weren't done due to time pressures (i.e. real life got in the way) while writing this!

It doesn't RUN as such, as there is no board creation / match 3 population functionality, it's just a best move check function!

Feel free to use this code (maybe say written by me if you do?) although I'm sure you can find similar stuff elsewhere on the web! Thnx!
